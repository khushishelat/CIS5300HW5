        "- *Warning*: Start this assignment early as it is dependent on the OpenAI API!\n",
        "- **Overview**: In this assignment, we will examine some of the latest language models you may be familiar with like GPT-3. We'll cover:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Zero-shot prompting\n",
        "  - Prompt engineering\n",
        "  - Few-shot prompting\n",
        "  - Prompting instruction-tuned models\n",
        "  - Chain-of-Thought Reasoning prompting\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OpenAI Account Setup**: You will need an OpenAI account and API key, you can [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup?launch) and learn [how to make an API key here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key). The OpenAI API is paid, however,  this homework will stay well under the free $5 credit given to each account. Be careful not to exhaust your free OpenAI credits while testing, you can check [on this page here](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage). To avoid exhausting your credits quickly, avoid running cells over and over again after you've completed an exercise.\n",
