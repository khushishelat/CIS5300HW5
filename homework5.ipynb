        "## Total Points: 104 points\n",
        "- *Warning*: Start this assignment early as it is dependent on the OpenAI API!\n",
        "- **Overview**: In this assignment, we will examine some of the latest language models you may be familiar with like GPT-3. We'll cover:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Zero-shot prompting\n",
        "  - Prompt engineering\n",
        "  - Few-shot prompting\n",
        "  - Prompting instruction-tuned models\n",
        "  - Chain-of-Thought Reasoning prompting\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OpenAI Account Setup**: You will need an OpenAI account and API key, you can [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup?launch) and learn [how to make an API key here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key). The OpenAI API is paid, however,  this homework will stay well under the free $5 credit given to each account. Be careful not to exhaust your free OpenAI credits while testing, you can check [on this page here](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage). To avoid exhausting your credits quickly, avoid running cells over and over again after you've completed an exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Deliverables:** This assignment has several deliverables:\n",
        "  - Code (this notebook) *(Automatic Graded)*\n",
        "    - Section 1: answers to questions\n",
        "    - Section 3: answers to questions\n",
        "    - Section 4: answers to question\n",
        "    - Section 5: answers to question\n",
        "  - Write Up (Report.pdf) *(Manually Graded)*\n",
        "    - Section 2: answers to questions\n",
        "    - Section 3: answers to question\n",

        "    - Section 5: answers to question\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Grading**: We will use the auto-grading system called `PennGrader`. To complete the homework assignment, you should implement anything marked with `#TODO` and run the cell with `#PennGrader` note.\n",

This makes it so that they are more performant without requiring as much prompt engineering and makes them more likely to succeed with just zero-shot prompting.

        "What we can see is that increasing the number of examples improves the language model's ability to arithmetic, and the chain-of-thought prompts do increasingly better than the regular few-shot prompts as the number of examples increases. I assume this is because the chain-of-thought prompts are able to better guide the language model to the correct sequence of operations required to calculate the answer, and the more examples there are, the more the language model is able to learn from the prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another interesting pattern from the chart is is a slight local maximum in performance at 2 examples for few-shot learning, and 1 example for chain-of-thought learning. We're not sure why this maximum exists so early, but perhaps having a small, but non-zero number of examples is actually more confusing to the language model than having 1 example or a very large number of examples."
